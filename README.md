## Best Hosting Platforms For Developers

### #1 [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

This is my favorite hosting platform for a couple of reasons, mainly because there is a production version and a development version, so you can take a look at the website before it is published. 

___

### #2 [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

There is nothing wrong with this platform, a great platform but I think that it needs some improvement on the deployment side since it takes a good 3 minutes for the site to fully deploy and be up.

### #3 [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

I love this hosting platform because it is so easy and fast to use, literally takes under 15 seconds to deploy a site. Even though its CLI based, they also have a tutorial on how to make a GitHub workflow to basically auto-publish from GitHub.

___

### #4 [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

I find it amazing that Cloudflare is joining in on the hosting market, as they just released a new platform called Cloudflare Pages. This is also another great platform that even comes in with Cloudflare's own analytics application that can be auto-added from a single click of a button.

___

### #5 [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)

This is decent overall but I've gotten banned from Heroku randomly and for no reason, I find this not reliable as it's not convenient to be worried if your gonna get randomly banned from a platform.

___

### #6 [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

This is another great platform, my only complaint is that the dashboard is too messy, and filled with a lot of random clusters. Another thing is that it is not easy to use so you might need to watch a tutorial or 2 to start deploying.

___

### #7 [Render](https://render.com/)

I don't have any complaints about this platform, but I just think that it has some time before I would be using it for my projects.

### #8 [Forestful](https://forestry.io/)

### #9 [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
